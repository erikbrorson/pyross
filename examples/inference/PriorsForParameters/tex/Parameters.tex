\section{Priors for parameters}
The best priors for the age independent rates we could find for SEAI8R are (in units of [1/day])\\
\\
$\gamma_{E}=1/2.72$   from exposed to activated $95\%$ CI:  $1/2.55$ $1/2.89$\\
\\
$\gamma_{A}= 1/3.12$   from activated to infected $95\%$ CI: $1/(2.08)$ $1/(4.16)$\\
\\
$\gamma_{Ia}= 1./7$           recovery rate of asymptomatic infectives (Can't really find a source for this beyond conventional wisdom)\\
\\
$\gamma_{Is}   = 1./4.82$  from symptomatic to hospitalised $95\%$ CI: $1/3.487$  $1/6.157$\\
\\
$\gamma_{Is}+\gamma_{Isp}=17.76$ from symptomatic to recovered, this value is very suspect and should be updated $95\%$ CI: $12.64$ $22.87$\\
\\
$\gamma_{Ih}+\gamma_{Ihp}= \ln(2)/10$ from hospital to recovered/leaving hospital (IQR $\ln(2)/7.0$ $\ln(2)/14.0$)\\
\\
$\gamma_{Ih} = 1/5.66$  from hospitalised to ICU $95\%$ CI: $1/4.18$ $1/7.14$\\
\\
$\gamma_{Ic} = 1/4  $ from ICU to recovered/leaving ICU IQR ($1/3$, $1/5$)\\
\\
$\gamma_{Ic} +\gamma_{Icp}  = 1/5.45$  from ICU to death $95\%$  CI:  $1/(2.20)$ $1/(7.65)$\\
\subsection{Sources}
These are the sources of some of the priors we use.\\

$\gamma_{Is}(1-hh)+\gamma_{Isp}$. This  $\gamma_{Is}$ probably isn't the one we should be using but it is the best we found for now.\\

 This seems to indicate roughly a third of mild cases develop a very weak immunity\\
\\
 \href{https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043018v2.full.pdf}{Susceptibility}This indicates younger people are less susceptible.  Roughly by two thirds less susceptible and it more or less goes to a constant by age 30.
